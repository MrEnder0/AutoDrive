# AutoUSB
A small test scripting language to turn usb thumb-drives into automatic scripts to make things easier with automation.

## Info
There will soon be a new project named AutoUSB mk2 that will replace this project this repo will still exist but receive very few updates other then bux fixes and small features but now most of the new work will only be in mk2.
The reason behind this is because I want to make one that's made for microcontrollers this will make there be no need for any software requirements to run these scripts on any pc.
Also mk2 will be smaller and more optimized.
